It’s a good book that involves many practical skills. I divide it into principles and methods. As shown below.

## Principles

![](https://image.kaleidoeye.org/negotiate.jpg)

### 1. Calm

You must be calm, which makes you better understand each other, know what your counterpart have said and you’re ready to say.

Remember to slow down the pace of negotiations!

### 2.Empathy

This means understanding your counterpart and also making him understand you.

Understanding you counterpart doesn’t means that you agree with each other, it’s just your mean that achieves your goal.

### 3.Information

Information is the most valuable resource in negotiations.

Sometimes the reason for disagreement is opaque information. Knowing what your counterpart wants most allows you to contain them. Information also makes it possible to expand the cake.

You should get more information as soon as possible.

Open up your sences, talk less, and listen more.

## Methods

### 1.Be a mirror

Repeat the last three words (or the critical one to three words) of what someone has said, which encourages the counterpaarts to reveal more information and their strategy and lets them know you’re listening.

### 2.Use the late night FM DJ voice

Voice can reveal mang information.

Infeat your voice download, keep it calm and slow, in which you create an aura of authority and trustworthiness without triggering defensiveness.

### 3.Labeling

Labeling is a way of validating someone’s emotion by acknowledging it. Give someone’ s emotions a name and you show identify how that persion feels, which can get you close to someone.

It can also exposing negative thoughts to daylight, making them seem less frightening.

Labels almosts always begin with roughly the some words:

1.  It sounds like…
2.  It seems like…
3.  It looks like…

Don’t begin with “I”, which gets people’s ground up,because it says you’re initerested in yourself.

If they disagree with the label, you can say “I didn’t say that was what it is, I just said it seems.”

After labeling, be silent at least 4 seconds. It invites the other persion to reveal himself.

Consiciously label each nagative feeling and replace it with positive, compassionate and solution-based thoughts.

Use labeling to list every terrible things your counterpart could say about you, which prepares you to head off nagative dynamics before they take root, which also encourages the other persion to claim that quite the opposite is true.

### 4.Master “No”

You should know that “Yes” is often a meaningless answer that hides deeps objections and “Maybe” is even worse.

Get them to say “No” early.

There are two ways:

1.  Say somethings that you know is totally wrong, which forces them listen and makes them comfortable correcting you.
2.  Ask the other party what they don’t want.

If you want someone to chat with you in social software， you can say “Is now a bad time to talk?”

If you want to get your counterpart to listen and engage with you, you can say “It seems that you want this project to fail.”

If you’re being ignored in social software by somethone you’re trying to do business, you can say “Have you given up the project?”, which suggests that you are ready to walk away.

### 5.That’s right.

Do you have used “you’re right” to get them to quit bothering you?

In a negotiation, you must know that their identification is not perfunctory, that is, you must let them really identify with you, which is also the meaning of “That’ right” rather than “You’re right”.

So before you convince them to see what you’re trying to accomplish, you should to say the things to them that will get them to say ,”That’ right”.

Summary is a good mean, which is the combination of rearticulating the meaning of what is said plus the acknoeledgment of the emotions underlying that meaning (paraphrasing + labeling = summary).

Paraphrasing is that repeating the other’s saying back to them in your own words.

### 6.Bend their reality

Don’t compromise, which is just like someone wears one black and one brown shoe. Creative solutions are almost always preced by some degree of risk, annoyance, confusion, and conflit.

You can:

1.  Open the deadline to public.
2.  Get them drop in “fair”.
3.  Archor
4.  Make sure your counterpart sees that there is something to lose by inaction.

### 7.Create the illusion of control

Giving your counterpart the illusion of control by asking calibrated questions——by asking for help.

Such as “How am I supposed to do that?”

Calibrated questions (usually begin with “How” and “What”) make your counterpart feel like they’re in charge, but it’s really you who are framing the conversation. Your counterpart will have no idea how constrained they are by your questions.

You can also describe what you’re looking for and ask for suggestions.
