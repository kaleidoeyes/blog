>Ticking away the  moments that make up a dull day
时辰滴答远去，组成烦闷的一天
Fritter and waste the hours in a offhand way
漫不经心，浪费时间
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your hometown
你在故乡的一片土地上游荡
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way
等待某人或某物明示你方向
<br>Tired of lying in the sunshine, staying home to watch the rain
倦懒地晒太阳，待在家，看雨点落下
You are young and life is long and There is time to kill today
你还年轻，生命很长，还有时间把今天打发
And then one day, you find ten years have got behind you
可是有一天，你发现十年已经过去
No one told you when to run, you missing the starting gun
没人告诉你何时奔跑，你错过了发令枪
<br>And your run and you run to catch up with the sun, but it's sinking
你跑啊跑，想赶上太阳，可它还是在落下
Racing around to come up behind you again
环绕一圈，在你背后再次升起
The sun is the same in a relative way, but you're older
太阳还是那个，但你已变老
Shorter of breath, and one day closer to death
呼吸更为急促，离死亡更近一步
<br>Every year is getting shorter, never seem to find the time
每年都在变短，像是再也找不到时间
Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines
计划搁浅，或是化为半页几行的胡乱涂画
Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way
在寂静的绝望中等待是英国佬的做法
The time is gone, the song is over, thought I'd something more to say
时间已过，此曲已终，可我想还有其他要说
<br>Home, home again
家，还是家
I like to be here when I can
我想要一直待在那
when I come home, cold and tired 
当我回到家，已经冰冷而疲倦
It's good to warm my bones beside the fire 
最好在炉火旁将我的身子温暖
<br>Far away, across the field
恍惚之间，穿过原野
Tolling of the iron bell
铁钟鸣响
Calls the faithful to their knees
召集信徒跪下
To hear the softly spoken magic spells
听这首轻柔的魔曲飘扬
