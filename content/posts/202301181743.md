Like the skin of a dying man
像是垂死之人的皮
<br>And night after night, we pretend it's alright

But I have grown older

And you have grown colder
而你在冷却
And nothing is very much anymore
再没什么值得一提
And I can feel one of my turns coming on
我能察觉到我的一个转变正在来到
I feel cold as a razor blade
我感觉如剃须刀片般寒冷
Tight as a tourniquet
如止血带般紧绷
Dry as a funeral drum
如丧鼓般干燥

跑到卧室，在左边的衣箱里
You'll find my favorite axe

Don't look so frightened
不要看起来这么恐惧 ~~你为什么看起来这么恐惧~~
This is just a passing phase
这只是一个在过去的时期
One of my bad days
